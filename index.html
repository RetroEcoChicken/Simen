    <div class="fixed"><p>This video shows me using a filesystem that i build from scratch on a VM running my OperatingSystem.<br> It can currently only handle a single sector of the harddrive so im limited to only 500 char's<br> however its still a big step from not beeing able to store anything on the harddrive and i still learn how to <br>manipulate files and parse them. <br><br>My operating system might be very basic but it does come with a norwegian keyboard driver as default.<br> It also has some barebones networking protocols but im still not able to ping websites.<br><br>The @B command stores everything behind it into a buffer that the kernel can then use.<br><br>The brackets {} tells the kernel that i want to execute a built in function and then the kernel searches for<br> a function of that name and expects the user to have set up the preperation steps if there is any. <br><br>{write} and {read} are functions built in to do direct requests from the ata driver. <br> <br> This is how i setup another buffer for dynamic file creation[filename][data] <br>It also formats the data so its ready to be written <br><br> The {addfile} function feeds the formatted data into the harddrive. It first gets the already existing data,<br> then adds the new data then writes everything to disk. This is because when you write you will overwrite <br> existing data.<br><br> The next video shows how i learned alot of what i now know. In this project i designed a program where<br> i could paint in ascii and then load these files into the gameengine. The game engine was build to run<br> in the command terminal. <br><br>This meant that i had to gradually collect data as i was painting then when i was done the data had<br> to be formated and written into a text file. This text file then had to be parsed by the game engine<br> to produce usable data inside the engine. For this i stored data in std::vector's. <br> This video was taken in 2022</p></div>
